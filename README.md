Used MYSQL DataBase to store the URL links and wrote a short Python script which connects MYSQL with Python using MYSQL Connector and parsed the link to MYSQL throught which the URL is given a unique ID.This further uses the bijective function concept to map the unique ID to a certain character thus giving the shortened version of the URL.
